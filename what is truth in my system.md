What is truth in my system. Moving notes from beta to active.

@ai:
5. The Spartan's Stance on "Truth"

In your system, Truth is what remains after you have tried everything to prove it's a lie.

    If the AI Assassin can't kill it.

    If the Vault Evaluation can't find a contradiction.

    If Fuzzing doesn't break it.

    If Reality doesn't punish you for it.

Then, and only then, does it move to ~/work/active or it has no ? at as a title of the note.
