So here are the types of questions you should ask when you are attacking in your scratch. The main idea is to ask questions so that you are not stuck in the why? why? why? why? loop, even though why? why? is good another approach or tools are just using good questions that target specific areas when you are in the scratch.

Good questions to start are the evaluation questions and then you move your way down. So you are working on bloom's taxonomy higher level. Studies show that, if you know the "So what?" and like work at the evaluation part it's more rewarding and easier to understand and remember and apply better. So work on the higher levels for and even analyse as well.

How to use these in your scratch.md

When you are transcribing and you feel the "urge to attack," don't just write "This is wrong." Pick a skillshot:

    Clarify: "Define [X] better."

    Assume: "You're assuming [X], but what if [Y]?"

    Evidence: "Show me the logs for this."

    Perspective: "An expert in [X] would call this trash because..."

    Consequence: "This leads to [X] failure later."

    Meta: "This whole topic is a distraction from the real goal."

The "Triangle" Example using the 6 Types:

    Source: "A triangle is a shape."

    Clarification: "What kind of shape? 2D or 3D?"

    Assumption: "Are you assuming the lines must be straight?"

    Evidence: "Can you show me a triangle with 4 sides? No? Then '3 sides' is the requirement."

    Perspective: "A topologist might say a triangle and a circle are the same. Why are we focusing on the sides?"

    Consequence: "If I define it this way, does it exclude 'curved' triangles on a sphere?"

    Meta: "Does defining a triangle actually help me build this bridge?"
