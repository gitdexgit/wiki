This is so useful try it out on your scratch and everyday problems as an initial step of analysis. It's a handy approach to any problem. And it's just common sense

You can find the root cause of a problem by asking why multiple times; the method is called "the 5 why", but it's not exactly about the number but more so the process so take as many why(s) as it takes you to find the root cause or causes. It's a good method to attempt identifying the root cause.


The method assumes that you know a system enough so that when it breaks you can just ask why and track back until you find the root cause. It is the simplest forms of debugging an issue. It's just common sense. But that's not always the case so it's a handy thing to do regardless.
