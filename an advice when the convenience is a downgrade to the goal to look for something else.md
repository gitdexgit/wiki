In any given system you want to make sure that the convenience factor of the
tools you are using doesn't hurt the goal or performance you are trying to
achieve, just because something can save you time or can do something for you
doesn't mean you shouldn't do it. If the process of actually doing it
contributes to the goal and you want to do it faster then look for other better
ways that are not necessary the best but at least they make you do it faster and
do it yourself when the process requires you to actually do the thing, for
example learning, no one can learn for you you still need to learn yourself.
