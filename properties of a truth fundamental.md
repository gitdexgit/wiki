to help me find truth fundamentals, they should have these bellow characteristics:

@ai:
A truth is fundamental if:

    It is Tool-Independent (Works in C, Python, and Assembly).

    It is Universal (Works on Linux, Windows, and a Toaster).

    It is a Constraint (You cannot "code your way around" it).

    It has no "It's like..." in the definition.

Don't worry about being "Right" on day one. Worry about being "Deep." Keep digging until you hit the hardware or the physics. That is where the "Gold" for an inventor is buried.
