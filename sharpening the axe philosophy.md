This principle is known as the **P/PC Balance** (Production vs. Production Capability), popularized by Stephen Covey. It is more commonly called **"Sharpening the Axe."**

# Maintain Growth Velocity

Neglecting your skill set while focusing solely on output leads to inevitable obsolescence and burnout.

Sustaining high-level performance requires balancing two competing forces:

### 1. The Output (80% of Time)
Focus on execution and results. This generates immediate value, pays the bills, and fulfills current commitments. Spending 100% of your time here makes you a "blunt tool"—you work harder and harder for smaller and smaller gains.

### 2. The Investment (20% of Time)
Focus on "Sharpening the Axe." Use this time to upgrade your tools, learn new languages, and refine your workflow. This ensures that your future "Output" hours are faster, easier, and more valuable.

### The Objective
Tracking these as separate categories allows you to audit your **Golden Ratio**.
*   If **Investment** is 0%, you are decaying.
*   If **Investment** is 100%, you are a hobbyist with no income.

**The Goal:** Target a 10%–20% tax on your week for growth to ensure you remain both profitable today and relevant tomorrow.
