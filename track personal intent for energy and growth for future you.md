### Mode 2 Reference Note

# Audit Personal Intent

**Comparing growth effort against restoration time reveals your actual rate of self-improvement.**

In Mode 2, use two tags to monitor intentional energy expenditure:

*   **hard**: Record activities that challenge your intellect or body to build new skills.
*   **easy**: Record activities that provide rest or entertainment to recover your focus.

**The Execution (Watson):**
*   `watson start Growth +hard +"Practicing complex algorithms"`
*   `watson start Life +easy +"Reading sci-fi novels"`

**Ignore routines. Track only the choices that move your energy needle.**
